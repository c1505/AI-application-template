# Purpose
- Make it easy to create and deploy applications that use AI
- It is more fun and rewarding to have something actually finished, deployed, and useable as a starting point that you can then build on top of.
- You will better discover what you actually need by building MVPs in this way.

# Limitations
- This guide and code is not meant for large scale production. It is meant to be a starting point for people who want to learn how to use AI in their applications. Creating an application for yourself and or a few people.
- It is optimized to be quick and easy to start, deploy, and learn from.

# How to use
- Get an open AI key

- Clone this repo
- create a virtual environment
- install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run the app using `streamlit run app.py`


# Deployment
Put your application on the web so you can easily access it

# suggestions
- Use chatgpt and or github copilot to help you write and troublelshoot your code
