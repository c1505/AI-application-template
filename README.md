# Purpose
- Make it easy to create and deploy applications that use AI
- It is more fun and rewarding to have something actually finished, deployed, and useable as a starting point that you can then build on top of.
- You will better discover what you actually need by building MVPs in this way.

# Limitations
- This guide and code is not meant for large scale production. It is meant to be a starting point for people who want to learn how to use AI in their applications. Creating an application for yourself and or a few people.
- It is optimized to be quick and easy to start, deploy, and learn from.

# How to use
- Get an open AI key.  set a low budget so you don't get surprised by the bill. You can always increase it.

- Clone this repo
- create a virtual environment
- install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run the app using `streamlit run app.py`

## customizing the application
- see RPG app for an example of how to customize the application

# features
- Estimates cost of API requests so you don't get surprised by the bill
- Includes conversation history and allows you to change how much if any to use

# Deployment
Put your application on the web so you can easily access it

# suggestions
- Use chatgpt and or github copilot to help you write and troublelshoot your code
- when your code gets to be long, consider some refactorings:
    - extract methods
    - separate display logic from business logic
- Use gpt3.5-turbo when you can instead of gpt-4. It is much cheaper.
